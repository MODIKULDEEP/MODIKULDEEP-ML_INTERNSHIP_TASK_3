As a Data Analytics and Machine Learning Intern it was my task to help John from STA IT services to create a linear regression model in Python or R to predict the CTC/Salary of new hires from the data provided.

1. Understand the data.
2. Transform categorical variables to the numerical variables.
3. Apply linear regression to predict the CTC.
4. Evaluate the results of the analysis.

Dataset:[Data_file.xlsx](https://github.com/MODIKULDEEP/MODIKULDEEP-ML_INTERNSHIP_TASK_3/files/9179468/Data_file.xlsx)
Data_file is a dataset that i used to train my model.

Test data:[Test_data_file.xlsx](https://github.com/MODIKULDEEP/MODIKULDEEP-ML_INTERNSHIP_TASK_3/files/9179470/Test_data_file.xlsx)
Test_Data_file is a dataset that you will use to test your model and find out the Mean Square Value.

You can find the result python notebbok file in the attached files as Salary_Prediction.ipynb
